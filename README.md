# News-API
Made a website using api from newsapi.org using html, css & js.
I got the api from news api.org, just sign-up and get your api key, but their's a catch!! 
They say that the api shouldn't be used in production but it gave me a headache in localhost as well... 
when it happens fo to your dev tools console and go to the 403 err, it'll have the link where you can easily request for temporary access.
I had huge help form google, YT and stackoverflow, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74336160/im-facing-problem-with-newsapi-org-api-i-cant-display-the-news-articles-on
